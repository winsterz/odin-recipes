Initial reflection (2/5/2024)

Getting the initial framework and webpages populated &  publishing on github took roughly 28 minutes in total. The actual work accomplished is quite barebones but adhereing to the instructions given.

Quick improvements that can be made off the top of my head:
1. Standardising the measurements shown across recipes. Initially I wrote out the 1 and 1/4 instead of directly copying from the website which I did for the easy-fried-rice recipe

2. Googling to find out how to edit the list items to have the prefix "Step" so that it is "Step 1", "Step 2" etc.

3. Including more intermediary photos so that it visually looks more appealing.
